CTFd Scores CTFtime
=====

This is a minimal plugin that just adds the `/scores` JSON API route back to CTFd after version 2.0.0 removed it. It formats CTFd's scoreboard into the [format expected by ctftime](https://ctftime.org/json-scoreboard-feed). This is mostly based on the implementation found in CTFd 1.2.0, just upgraded for 2.0.0 and above.
